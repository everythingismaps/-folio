Chernarus: a forgotten region in the windswept depths of Eastern Europe, it still bears the scars of a recent past dominated by the Soviet Union.

Today it is at the epicentre of a zombie outbreak sweeping across the world. Ordinary citizens fight for survival against marauding bandits, rogue military units and hordes of wandering undead.

None of this is of course true. Chernarus is famous not as the scene of a civilisation-destroying zombie apocalypse, but rather as the fictional setting for the popular DayZ survival video game.

As an avid player, I could hardly pass up the cartographical opportunities that this massive 225 km<sup>2</sup> map presented. This map of an imagined pre-outbreak public transport system is my first dive into the depths of the extensive DayZ lore and geography.

This is a revised version of a project to map a plausible pre-apocalypse public transport system for Chernarus. The first version, available <a href="https://philam.github.io/chernaruspublictransport/" target="_blank">here</a>, has a number of issues and areas for improvement.

I took a number of these issues into consideration when making the new map. The first and most obvious is the inefficient use of space. Schematic maps are not intended to replicate actual geography. Rather, they are intended to make the network as simple and legible as possible. Most cities have adopted this approach to mapping their transport systems. Even Melbourne's well-established geography-based map <a href="https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/news-and-events/news/new-train-network-map-for-victoria/" target="_blank">was recently changed</a> on this basis.

The map's presentation has also been completeley remade from the ground up. Using a colour palette inspired by 1980s propaganda posters from the Soviet Union, new colours have replaced the fairly generic graphics of the first version. Open Sans has been substituted by '<a href="http://www.dafont.com/denis-sherbak.d2018" target="_blank">Snowstorm'</a>, a fantastic font by Denis Sherbak.

Some other changes from the previous version include:
<ul>
	<li>Adding a new bus stop at NWAF (North West Airfield) and Topolka Dam</li>
	<li>Reorganising the legend for space efficiency</li>
	<li>Changing railway colour scheme and station shapes</li>
	<li>Adding 'Chernarus Transit' logo</li>
</ul>
