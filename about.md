Cartography is one of the most important ways in which we orient ourselves and visualise our surroundings. Even though we now have technology like GPS to guide us, maps remain just as important as ever.

This site is dedicated to the maps that I make and publish. I generally map things related to Melbourne but I like to keep my options open. <!-- The code is already in, just name your picture "prof_pic.jpg" and put it in the img folder. --->

You can find out more about me on my <a href="http://philipmallis.com">website</a>.
