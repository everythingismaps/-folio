After a recent hiatus due to a long holiday overseas, I have resumed work on a project that I have been intermittently working on for a few months.

Put simply, it involves creating a new and improved schematic map of Melbourne's extensive tram network. I had actually begun work on this and come up with a first draft before Yarra Trams published its recent <a href="https://static.ptv.vic.gov.au/public-transport-victoria/1491350490/PTVH2153_TramNetworkMap_A3_L_March2017_v1_FA_LOCKED.pdf">official updated map</a> on 1 May this year.

So far I have almost finished sorting out most of the basic route layout and order in this second draft. With the large number of routes and interchanges, it takes a lot longer than you might think. As always, it is important to find the balance between visual appeal and practical information and create a useable yet aesthetically-pleasing map.

Here are a couple of snippets of progress so far. Obviously this is a rough and incomplete version of what will be the final product. Everything is subject to change and most elements have not been implemented yet (e.g. route colours).

Enjoy!
