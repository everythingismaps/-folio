Every website has to start somewhere.

This one is for maps that I create and publish. These have most recently made since I began studying urban planning and found some incredible uses for cartographical material. Setting up a place where I can more appropriately and comprehensively discuss these designs seems like a good idea (but only time will tell).

I have published maps on Github before. The first few posts will be giving some context on these early ones while I get started on a few new projects.

More general information is available on the 'about' page in the top navigation bar.
